# pysr-mcp-server
MCP wrapper to expose PySR symbolic regression capabilities via a modular context-aware Python server.

## Overview
`pysr-mcp-server` is a Python-based server that wraps the [PySR](https://github.com/MilesCwith a **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** interface. It enables context-aware model invocation, dynamic configuration, and remote access to symbolic regression workflows.

This project is designed for integration into emerging tech environments where symbolic modeling needs to be orchestrated across multiple contexts and systems.

## Key Features
- MCP-compliant interface for PySR
- Context-aware model invocation
- RESTful API for remote access
- Modular and extensible architecture
- Configurable via YAML or JSON
